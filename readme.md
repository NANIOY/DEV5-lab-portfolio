## An interesting new feature of ES2018
Spread syntax, introduced in ES2018, is a useful feature in JavaScript that allows you to spread out the elements of an array, string, or key-value pairs of an object in various situations. It's like taking the contents of a container and placing them individually wherever they're needed.

For example:
- In function calls, you can use spread syntax to pass multiple arguments easily.
- In array literals, you can combine arrays or add elements to an existing array.
- In object literals, you can merge objects or add new key-value pairs to an object.

Spread syntax simplifies working with data by making it more flexible and readable in your code.

### [An example of this is from MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

    const parts = ["shoulders", "knees"];
    const lyrics = ["head", ...parts, "and", "toes"];
    //Output: ["head", "shoulders", "knees", "and", "toes"]

### [Conditionally adding values to an array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
    const isSummer = false;
    const fruits = ["apple", "banana", ...(isSummer ? ["watermelon"] : [])];
    //Output: ['apple', 'banana']
